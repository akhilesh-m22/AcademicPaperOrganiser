  IMPORTANT: This migration file is NOT needed if you run the main SQL file.
  
  The main SQL file is located at: server/sql/AcademicPaperOrganiser.sql
  
  That file contains the complete database schema including:

  - The password column (VARCHAR(255))
  - The is_admin column (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
  - All triggers, stored procedures, and functions
  - Sample data including the admin user
  
  TO SET UP THE DATABASE:
  1. Open MySQL Workbench or MySQL command line
  2. Run the complete SQL file: server/sql/AcademicPaperOrganiser.sql
  3. Do NOT run this init.sql file - it's kept only for reference
